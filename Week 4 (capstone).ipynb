    "#### Now that you have been equipped with the skills and the tools to use location data to explore a geographical location, over the course of two weeks, you will have the opportunity to be as creative as you want and come up with an idea to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore or compare neighborhoods or cities of your choice or to come up with a problem that you can use the Foursquare location data to solve. If you cannot think of an idea or a problem, here are some ideas to get you started:"

    "1. In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea."

    "The nature of this problem is like to compare the quality of life and demographics of major cities. Here, the major cities we are interesed in is New York, Toronto, or Paris. \n",
    "\n",
    "To ditermine how similar or dissimilar these cities are, we need to import demographic data/information for New York and Toronto (or Paris). Foursquare API is a good source for demographic data. To make good use of the Foursquare location data, the labs done for New York and Toronto segmented and clustered neighborhoods would provide good examples for new ideas.\n",

    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>1. leverage the Foursquare location data to solve or execute: data science problems always target an audience and are meant to help a group of stakeholders solve a problem, so make sure that I explicitly describe the audience and why they would care about this problem. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>2. choose the 10 most common venues in each district from New York and Toronto: the data set is about 2014 New York City Neighborhood Names. After transforming the data to Json files, it is easy to use Pandas to transform them into DataFrame. Then select the required data columns to appear and get the information we want. </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue>3. well-using the geo information: the geopy library is used to get the latitude and longitude values. With the locations the maps can be created and provide a direct understanding of the neighborhoods and the purposed areas. The Folium library is also used to show maps on different requirements.</font>\n",

    "Above steps are my suggestions to breakdown the data analysis process. Overall, different analysis on New York and Toronto will give us the related better data to start a company and choose a good place to resident in. "
